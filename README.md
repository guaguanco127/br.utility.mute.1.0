These files were created with Max/MSP version 8.5.6, or RNBO 1.2.3. Links on how to use and/or install below. 

This is a basic patch/external/plugin/device that allows the user to simply mute the signal without creating any clicks or pops. Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.  

You can use as a Max for Live device within Ableton Live Suite, or as an abstration or external object within Max/MSP. You can also build your own VST or AU audio plugin to use with a DAW.
