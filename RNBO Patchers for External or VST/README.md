## <a name="About"></a>About

A click-free mute. Switching a gain straight from 1 to 0 cuts the wave mid-swing, and that jump is heard as a click. br.utility.mute moves the gain along a 10 ms S-curve instead: too fast to hear as a fade, smooth enough that nothing clicks, and it lands on true silence. Works at any sample rate.

One patch now does both jobs (1.0 had two). Inside [rnbo~], the Mute param is the plugin parameter, and inlet 3 sets the same param, so the external has the same three inlets as the abstraction: L, R, Mute. The gen~ code inside is the same as br.utility.mute.stereo.2.0.

## <a name="External"></a>What is an External for Max/MSP?

An external is a type of object that does not come with your Max/MSP library. Unlike the typical objects that you can call on all versions of Max/MSP, an external must be installed on the user's computer a specific way. 

## <a name="VST"></a>What is a VST or AU Audio Plugin? 

A VST is a third party audio plugin generally run within a digital audio workstation (DAW). A VST is cross platform for both Windows and Mac. An AU works the same way but is Mac only. 

## <a name="Export"></a>How To Export as a Max/MSP External

1. Make sure Max 9 is installed on your computer, and that you have an RNBO license.

2. Open br.utility.mute.stereo.rnbo.2.0.maxpat.

3. Double-click the [rnbo~] object while the patch is locked.

4. Click "Show Export Sidebar" on the right-hand side.

5. Select "Max External Export".

6. Name the object br.utility.mute.stereo.2.0~ and export.

**Keep the ~ at the end of the name.** Without it, the external has exactly the same name as the abstraction br.utility.mute.stereo.2.0, and Max loads whichever one it finds first, so you can't be sure which one you're using. The ~ also follows the Max convention for objects that process audio. Any other name is fine as long as it isn't the name of an abstraction you also use.

7. Copy the exported .mxo (Mac) or .mxe64 (Windows) into a folder on Max's search path, for example Documents/Max 9/Externals, and add that folder in Options > File Preferences if it isn't listed. Then create an object called br.utility.mute.stereo.2.0~ in any patch. It has the same inlets as the abstraction (L, R, Mute), except that Mute takes numbers only.

## <a name="ExportVST"></a>How To Export as a VST or AU Audio Plugin

**Please note that you can only use an audio plugin on the same computer that you created it with RNBO. Sending an audio plugin to another computer will not work and be flagged as an unrecognized developer** 

1. Make sure Max 9 is installed on your computer, and that you have an RNBO license.

2. Open br.utility.mute.stereo.rnbo.2.0.maxpat.

3. Double-click the [rnbo~] object while the patch is locked.

4. Select "Audio Plugin Export".

5. Choose VST3 or AU and the platform, name your plugin, and export. The Mute parameter shows up in your DAW for automation.
