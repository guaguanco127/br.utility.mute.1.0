## <a name="About"></a>About

These files were created with Max/MSP version 8.5.6, or RNBO 1.2.3. Links on how to use and/or install below. 

This is a basic Ableton Max for Live device that allows the user to simply mute the signal without creating any clicks or pops. Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.  

You can use as a Max for Live device within Ableton Live Suite, or as an abstration or external object within Max/MSP. You can also build your own VST or AU audio plugin to use with a DAW. 

There are two different versions:

The first one, br.utility.mute.1.0.amxd, is a device build using gen~.  
The second one, br.utility.mute.basic.1.0.amxd, uses only MSP objects without the use of gen~. This version is more basic and heavily commented. 

The purpose for having these two different versions is so that novices to Max/MSP can learn how basic devices can be created by observing the basic version. Additionally, those familiar to Max/MSP that are novices to gen~ can learn by comparing the two versions. 


## <a name="M4L"></a>What Is a Max For Live Device?

Max For Live brings the power and flexibility of Max to Ableton Live. Max For Live gives you access to hundreds of exclusive custom plug-ins (Live Devices) as well as the tools to build your own. These can be MIDI and audio effects, audio and video synthesizers, 3D Jitter visuals, as well as tools that interact with the Live application itself, via the Live API.
